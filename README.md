# Integrated dynamic login and display user role based header.
The dynamic login method has been successfully integrated. You can access the login form at the URL below:
https://blog.wcr.is/test-1/
Additionally, you can embed this form on any other page by using the following shortcode:
 [wcr_login_form]
Here are the screenshots showing the header based on the userâ€™s login status and roles:
 Logged Out: https://imgsh.net/i/09438fc14b
 Logged-in (Client, "blog" permission): https://imgsh.net/i/8a1d5e8cf4
 Logged-in (Client, "org_admin" permission): https://imgsh.net/i/c466e6ef3c
You can also assign different user login statuses or roles to specific menu items. See the below screenshots for examples:
